This source code repository contains the source code of the Python Machine Learning model that was created for the Cloud Machine Learning module of the Postgraduate Diploma in Cloud Computing at the National College of Ireland. The goal of this ML model is to predict stock market prices. It uses RNN, LSTM and Adamax.

The repository also contains the Dockerised images of this project. The built images are stored in DockerHub:
